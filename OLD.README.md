# Canvas Flow Studio

Canvas Flow Studio is an innovative web application designed to empower users to create, visualize, and run complex Artificial Intelligence workflows through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

> **Note:** This application is currently operating under a temporary name. A formal renaming is planned for the future as the project evolves.

## Overview

Canvas Flow Studio democratizes access to AI capabilities by providing a dynamic digital canvas where users can visually connect different functional blocks (nodes) to build sophisticated AI-driven processes. Moving beyond traditional coding or complex setups, this application enables users to:

- Start with basic inputs like text or images
- Feed them into versatile "Instruction" nodes powered by various AI models
- Process outputs and chain nodes together to achieve complex results
- Visualize the entire workflow in a clear, intuitive interface

Whether you're a creative professional, developer, researcher, or business user, Canvas Flow Studio enables you to experiment with, prototype, and deploy custom AI solutions without requiring deep technical expertise in specific AI models.

## Features

- **Visual Node-Based Editor**: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for creating AI workflows
- **Diverse Node Types**: Text, image, instruction nodes and more
- **AI Model Integration**: Support for various text generation, image generation, and analysis models including Gemini 2.0 Flash and Google Cloud TTS
- **Real-time Previews**: See outputs from each node as you build your workflow
- **Workflow Saving & Loading**: Save your workflows and load them for future use or modification
- **Customizable Node Parameters**: Fine-tune AI instructions and parameters for precise results
- **Canvas Navigation**: Zoom, pan, and organize your workflow for clarity
- **Export Capabilities**: Export your results and entire workflows

We continuously work to expand our supported models based on user needs and technological advancements.

## Pricing & Subscriptions

Canvas Flow Studio offers multiple subscription tiers to accommodate different user needs:

- **Free (0€)**: A generous free tier for learning and experimenting with AI workflows
- **Plus (4€/month)**: Increased rate limits and additional features for regular users
- **Pro (10€/month)**: Highest rate limits and full access to all premium features

We're committed to maintaining a balance between accessibility and sustainability. Our approach ensures that casual users and learners have access to powerful AI capabilities through our free tier, while providing enhanced features and higher usage limits for power users through our paid subscriptions.

All subscriptions are managed through Stripe's secure payment processing system.
